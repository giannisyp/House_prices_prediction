## In this project we analyze and explore the Boston house price data 
Some of the features of the datase are shown below :

## Split data for training and testing.

We use a 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

## Run a Multivariable Regression.

## Evaluate how the model's coefficients and residuals.

## Use data transformation to improve the model performance. 
Data transformation approach. 

* Plot the log prices using Seaborn and calculate the skew. 
* The log transformation is often used to reduce skewness of a measurement variable

Using the logarithm of one or more variables improves the fit of the model by transforming the distribution of the features to a more normally-shaped bell curve

## Use the model to estimate a property price based on the property specs.
