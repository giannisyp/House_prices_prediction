## In this project we analyze and explore the Boston house price data 
Linear Regression on Boston Housing Dataset
Housing dataset which contains information about different houses in Boston.This data was originally a part of UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been removed now.

We can also access this data from the scikit-learn library.

There are 506 samples and 13 feature variables in this dataset. The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features.

This is a copy of UCI ML housing dataset.

## Split data for training and testing.

We use a 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

## Run a Multivariable Regression.

## Evaluate how the model's coefficients and residuals.

## Use data transformation to improve the model performance. 
Data transformation approach. 

* Plot the log prices using Seaborn and calculate the skew. 
* The log transformation is often used to reduce skewness of a measurement variable

Using the logarithm of one or more variables improves the fit of the model by transforming the distribution of the features to a more normally-shaped bell curve

## Use the model to estimate a property price based on the property specs.
